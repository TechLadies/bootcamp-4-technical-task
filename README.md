## 1. Introduction

The TechLadies Bootcamp #4 is a 12-week part-time accelerated learning program designed for women who wish to be professional programmers. Participants will be guided by industry experts to create products for Sustainable Solutions Network Singapore (SSN Singapore) OR Centre for a Responsible Future (CRF) using JavaScript technologies.

Visit [the bootcamp info page](http://www.techladies.co/techladies-bootcamp-4/) for more details.

## 2. The Technical Task

As part of the application process, you will need to complete a technical task. This will help us evaluate your technical capabilities for the bootcamp. Don't let the technical task scare you! We are here to help you acquire the skills you need to complete the task with 3 prebootcamp workshops covering the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Express, and MongoDB and walking you through building a simple web application, as well as [a list of online resources below.](#resources)

**Technical Task**: *Create a to-do list web application using [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/).*

This application should have the following features:
1. An **About Me page** with a few paragraphs describing who you are, why you want to be part of the TechLadies Bootcamp, and include one image (it can be a photo of yourself or anything you like (cats are always a good option!))
2. A **To-Do page** where a user can add to-do tasks to a list, update existing tasks, delete existing tasks, and mark tasks as done.
3. A **navigation bar** which allows you to navigate between the About Me and To-Do page.

This need only be a pure front-end application, we do not need you to store the data to a database (so it's fine if your to-dos disappear when you refresh the page).

***Hat tip***: To stand out from the rest, you are highly encourage to not follow a single online tutorial to the T. Do read up on multiple resources to understand the concepts or google your way to finding how to accomplish what you want to code.

### Want to increase your chances of being selected for the bootcamp?

Complete the Bonus Task for extra points! The Bonus Task builds on top of the Technical Task and is more complex.

It's not mandatory to complete this task and skipping this task does not preclude you from being accepted for bootcamp. But if you're itching for a challenge, try this!

**Bonus Task**: *Integrate your to-do list web application with a NodeJS server (backend) built with the Express web framework, connected to a MongoDB database.*

This application should have the following feature:
1. Your to-dos should be saved to a database. That means you should still see your to-dos after you refresh the page.

### Want some Brownie Points?

To stretch your knowledge even further (remember, we are here to help!), try the following:

**Brownie Points**: *Deploy your web application to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).*

This will require knowing how to use a version control system such as [Git](https://git-scm.com/). You can complete this task whether you're doing only the Technical Task (to deploy a pure front-end app), or the Bonus Task (to deploy the full-stack application).

### Sample Application

Here is a link to a [sample technical task application](https://tech-task-sample-app.herokuapp.com/) (do note that it may take some time for the webpage to load). This is just to give you an idea of what you can build and what your final product might look like. *In no way are we expecting you to replicate this or do anything in a similar style (we don't want to limit your creativity!). However, it is also perfectly fine if you choose to do so.*

## 3. Submitting Your Entry

1. After you have finished building your personal website, you will need to share the source code with us. You should do so:
  - Through a link to a [Git repository](https://git-scm.com) on [GitHub](https://github.com) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) (its free!)
  - Through a link to a [Zip file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_(file_format)) on [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com) or [Google Drive](http://drive.google.com).
2. Visit [fill in url for new form here]
3. [change instructions accordingly] Under section 2, include the URL (web address) of where we can find your file.
